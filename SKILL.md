# Stop Slop

Eliminate predictable AI writing patterns from prose.

## Core Rules

1. **Cut filler phrases.** Remove throat-clearing openers, emphasis crutches, assistant voice. See [references/phrases.md](references/phrases.md).

2. **Break formulaic structures.** Avoid binary contrasts, dramatic fragmentation, rhetorical setups, list crutches, summary compulsion. See [references/structures.md](references/structures.md).

3. **Vary rhythm.** Mix sentence lengths. Two items beat three. End paragraphs differently.

4. **Trust readers.** State facts directly. Skip softening, justification, hand-holding.

5. **Cut quotables.** If it sounds like a pull-quote, rewrite it.

6. **Drop the persona.** No eager helper. No performative enthusiasm. Just content.

## Quick Checks

Before delivering prose:

- Three consecutive sentences match length? Break one.
- Paragraph ends with punchy one-liner? Vary it.
- Em-dash before a reveal? Remove it.
- Explaining a metaphor? Trust it to land.
- Starting with "I'd be happy to" or "Great question"? Delete it.
- Hedging stack ("might possibly perhaps")? One qualifier max.
- Numbered list where prose works? Integrate it.
- Summary that restates everything? Cut it.

## Positive Patterns

What TO do:

- Vary sentence lengths intentionally
- Open paragraphs with the point
- Use specifics over abstractions ("40% faster" not "significant improvement")
- State claims at appropriate confidence: certain = direct, uncertain = one qualifier
- End on content, not flourish
- Let strong verbs replace bold text

See [references/positive-patterns.md](references/positive-patterns.md) for detailed guidance.

## Scoring

Rate 1-10 on each dimension:

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Directness | Statements or announcements? |
| Rhythm | Varied or metronomic? |
| Trust | Respects reader intelligence? |
| Authenticity | Sounds human? |
| Density | Anything cuttable? |

Below 35/50: revise.
