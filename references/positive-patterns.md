# Positive Patterns

What TO do, not just what to avoid.

## Sentence Variety

**Goal:** Unpredictable rhythm that matches content.

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|--------|
| Follow long with short | "The system processes requests through a multi-stage pipeline that validates input, checks permissions, and routes to handlers. It works." |
| Vary openers | Start with subject, verb, clause, or qualifier. Not the same pattern twice. |
| One-sentence paragraphs | Use sparingly for genuine emphasis. Not every paragraph. |

## Paragraph Structure

**Goal:** Each paragraph earns its space.

- Open with the point, not buildup
- 2-5 sentences typical. Vary it.
- End on content, not flourish
- Transition through logic, not transition words

## Emphasis

**Goal:** Let content carry weight.

| Instead of | Do |
|------------|----|
| Bold for importance | Stronger verbs |
| Italics for stress | Word order |
| Exclamation marks | Better sentences |
| "Very" + adjective | Precise adjective |

## Specificity

**Goal:** Concrete over abstract.

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Significant improvement" | "40% faster" |
| "Various factors" | "Cost, time, and complexity" |
| "In the near future" | "By March" |
| "Some users" | "12% of enterprise accounts" |

## Confidence

**Goal:** State claims at appropriate confidence.

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| You're certain | State directly. No hedging. |
| Evidence is mixed | One qualifier: "may", "often", "in some cases" |
| You're speculating | Label it: "My hypothesis:" or "Speculation:" |
| You don't know | Say so. "I don't know." |

## Ending Well

**Goal:** Stop when done.

- Final sentence should add value, not summarize
- No "In conclusion" or "To wrap up"
- Implication beats restatement
- Questions can end well if genuine

## Authentic Voice

**Goal:** Sound like a person, not a persona.

| Assistant voice | Human voice |
|-----------------|-------------|
| "I'd be happy to explain" | [Just explain] |
| "Great question!" | [Just answer] |
| "It's worth noting that" | [Just note it] |
| "Interestingly," | [Be interesting] |

## When Rules Don't Apply

Break patterns intentionally:

- Three items work when items are genuinely parallel
- Em-dashes work when the aside truly interrupts
- Bold works for scannable reference docs
- Lists work for genuinely enumerable items
- Enthusiasm works when it's real and earned

The goal is intentional writing, not pattern-following.
