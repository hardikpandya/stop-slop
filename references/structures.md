# Structures to Avoid

## Binary Contrasts

These create false drama. State the point directly.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Not because X. Because Y." | Telegraphed reversal |
| "[X] isn't the problem. [Y] is." | Formulaic reframe |
| "The answer isn't X. It's Y." | Predictable pivot |
| "It feels like X. It's actually Y." | Setup/reveal cliche |
| "The question isn't X. It's Y." | Rhetorical misdirection |
| "Not X. But Y." | Mechanical contrast |
| "It's not this. It's that." | Same formula, different words |
| "stops being X and starts being Y" | False transformation arc |

**Instead:** State Y directly. "The problem is Y." "Y matters here."

## Dramatic Fragmentation

Sentence fragments for emphasis read as manufactured profundity.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "[Noun]. That's it. That's the [thing]." | Performative simplicity |
| "X. And Y. And Z." | Staccato drama |
| "This unlocks something. [Word]." | Artificial revelation |

**Instead:** Complete sentences. Trust content over presentation.

## Rhetorical Setups

These announce insight rather than deliver it.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "What if [reframe]?" | Socratic posturing |
| "Here's what I mean:" | Redundant preview |
| "Think about it:" | Condescending prompt |
| "And that's okay." | Unnecessary permission |

**Instead:** Make the point. Let readers draw conclusions.

## Formulaic Constructions

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "By the time X, I was Y." | Narrative template |
| "X that isn't Y" | Indirect. Say "X is broken" |

## Rhythm Patterns

| Pattern | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Three-item lists | Use two items or one |
| Questions answered immediately | Let questions breathe or cut them |
| Paragraphs starting with "So" | Start with content |
| Sentences starting with "Look," | Remove |
| Every paragraph ends punchily | Vary endings |
| Em-dashes before reveals | Use periods or commas |
| Staccato fragmentation | Don't stack short punchy sentences |
| Dashes for dramatic pause | Use commas or periods |
| "Not always. Not perfectly." | Hedging disguised as reassurance |

## Word Patterns

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Absolute words (always, never, everyone, everybody, nobody) | False authority |
| AI-overused intensifiers (deeply, truly, fundamentally, inherently, simply, literally, inevitably) | Empty emphasis |

## Format Slop

Formatting patterns that signal AI generation.

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Bullet points where prose works | Fragmenting ideas that flow naturally | Write connected paragraphs |
| Emoji-decorated headings (rocket, lightbulb, checkmark) | Infantilizing, visually noisy | Remove emojis from headings |
| `- **Bold label:** description` lists | Inline-header vertical lists | Incorporate into prose or use real headings |
| Boldface on every other phrase | Mechanical emphasis | Bold only what truly needs emphasis, or nothing |
| Title Case In Every Heading | ChatGPT default, not standard | Use sentence case |
| Numbered lists for non-sequential items | Imposing false order | Use bullets or prose |

**Register note:** Bullet points and headers are appropriate in `technical` register (reference docs, READMEs). Flag them in `casual`, `professional`, and `narrative`.

## Superficial -ing Analyses

Trailing present participle clauses that fake depth. They add no information.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "...highlighting its importance" | Tells you something is important without showing why |
| "...ensuring reliability" | Asserts an outcome without evidence |
| "...showcasing the team's commitment" | Promotional, not descriptive |
| "...reflecting broader trends" | Vague gesture at significance |
| "...underscoring the need for" | Announcing importance instead of demonstrating it |
| "...fostering collaboration" | What does this actually mean in practice? |
| "...contributing to a more sustainable future" | Generic aspiration |

**Instead:** Delete the -ing clause. If the information matters, give it its own sentence with evidence.

## False Ranges

"From X to Y" constructions where X and Y aren't on a meaningful scale.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "from hobbyist experiments to enterprise rollouts" | Vague sweep |
| "from the Big Bang to the cosmic web" | Dramatic but content-free |
| "from solo developers to cross-functional teams" | Scale-faking |

**Instead:** Pick the specific claim that matters and support it.

## Rule of Three Overuse

LLMs force ideas into groups of three to appear comprehensive. Two items often suffice.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "innovation, inspiration, and industry insights" | Alliterative padding |
| "speed, quality, cost" | Cliche triad |
| "streamlining processes, enhancing collaboration, and fostering alignment" | Three vague verbs |

**Instead:** Use two items. Or one. State what actually matters.

## Elegant Variation (Synonym Cycling)

Repetition-penalty code causes LLMs to substitute synonyms for the same thing, creating confusion about whether different words refer to different concepts.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "The protagonist... The main character... The central figure... The hero..." | Are these four different people? |
| "The study... The research... The investigation... The inquiry..." | Ambiguity |
| "The company... The firm... The organization... The enterprise..." | Same entity, four names |

**Instead:** Pick one term and reuse it. Repetition is clarity.

## Generic Positive Conclusions

Vague upbeat endings that could apply to anything.

- "The future looks bright"
- "Exciting times lie ahead"
- "This represents a major step in the right direction"
- "As we continue this journey toward excellence"
- "The possibilities are endless"

**Instead:** End with a specific claim, a concrete next step, or nothing. Not every piece needs a conclusion.

## Challenges-and-Prospects Formula

"Despite challenges... continues to thrive" is an LLM default structure for any topic.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Despite its challenges, X continues to..." | Formulaic resilience narrative |
| "While facing obstacles, X remains committed to..." | Same formula |
| "Challenges and Future Outlook" as a heading | Template section |

**Instead:** Name the specific challenge. Name the specific response. Or omit if you have nothing concrete to say.

## Knowledge-Cutoff Disclaimers

Hedges about incomplete information that leak from chatbot context into content.

- "As of [date]"
- "Up to my last training update"
- "While specific details are limited/scarce..."
- "Based on available information..."
- "Details about X are not extensively documented in readily available sources"

**Instead:** State what you know with specific sources. If you don't know, don't write about it.
