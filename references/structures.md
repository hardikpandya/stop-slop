# Structures to Avoid

## Binary Contrasts

These create false drama. State the point directly.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Not because X. Because Y." | Telegraphed reversal |
| "[X] isn't the problem. [Y] is." | Formulaic reframe |
| "The answer isn't X. It's Y." | Predictable pivot |
| "It feels like X. It's actually Y." | Setup/reveal cliche |
| "The question isn't X. It's Y." | Rhetorical misdirection |
| "Not X. But Y." | Mechanical contrast |
| "It's not this. It's that." | Same formula, different words |
| "stops being X and starts being Y" | False transformation arc |

**Instead:** State Y directly. "The problem is Y." "Y matters here."

## Dramatic Fragmentation

Sentence fragments for emphasis read as manufactured profundity.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "[Noun]. That's it. That's the [thing]." | Performative simplicity |
| "X. And Y. And Z." | Staccato drama |
| "This unlocks something. [Word]." | Artificial revelation |

**Instead:** Complete sentences. Trust content over presentation.

## Rhetorical Setups

These announce insight rather than deliver it.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "What if [reframe]?" | Socratic posturing |
| "Here's what I mean:" | Redundant preview |
| "Think about it:" | Condescending prompt |
| "And that's okay." | Unnecessary permission |
| "Here's the thing about X:" | Delayed payload |
| "Let me explain:" | Announces instead of does |

**Instead:** Make the point. Let readers draw conclusions.

## List Crutch

Turning everything into numbered items signals formulaic thinking.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "3 things you need to know" | Clickbait format |
| "5 steps to X" | Oversimplification |
| "Here are the key points:" + bullets | Lazy organization |
| "First... Second... Third..." | Mechanical progression |
| Everything becomes a listicle | Avoids integrated argument |

**Instead:** Integrate points into prose. Use lists only for genuinely parallel items.

## Header Overuse

Excessive structure for short content.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Headers every 2-3 sentences | Fragmented reading |
| "Introduction" / "Conclusion" headers | Obvious, unnecessary |
| Nested headers (H2 > H3 > H4) for simple content | Over-engineering |

**Instead:** Let paragraphs do the work. Headers for major transitions only.

## Summary Compulsion

Restating everything at the end.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "To summarize what we covered..." | Redundant |
| "Key takeaways:" section | Assumes reader didn't read |
| Conclusion that repeats introduction | Circular, no new insight |
| "In this article, we discussed..." | Padding |

**Instead:** End with your strongest point or implication. No recap.

## Formulaic Constructions

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "By the time X, I was Y." | Narrative template |
| "X that isn't Y" | Indirect. Say "X is broken" |
| "Here's what you need to know:" | Announces structure |
| "The short answer is... The long answer is..." | Padding |

## Bold Abuse

Using bold for emphasis instead of letting words work.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| **Key point** in every paragraph | Dilutes emphasis |
| Bold phrases instead of clear writing | Crutch |
| Bold for "important" words | Reader should judge importance |

**Instead:** Use bold sparingly. Strong verbs beat bold nouns.

## Parenthetical Asides

Interrupting flow with tangents.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "X (and this is important) Y" | Just say it's important |
| "The result (unsurprisingly) was" | Editorializing |
| Excessive clarifications in parens | Weak main sentence |

**Instead:** Integrate or cut. If it matters, it belongs in the sentence.

## Rhythm Patterns

| Pattern | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Three-item lists | Use two items or one |
| Questions answered immediately | Let questions breathe or cut them |
| Paragraphs starting with "So" | Start with content |
| Sentences starting with "Look," | Remove |
| Every paragraph ends punchily | Vary endings |
| Em-dashes before reveals | Use periods or commas |
| Staccato fragmentation | Don't stack short punchy sentences |
| Dashes for dramatic pause | Use commas or periods |
| "Not always. Not perfectly." | Hedging disguised as reassurance |

## Word Patterns

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Absolute words (always, never, everyone, everybody, nobody) | False authority |
| AI-overused intensifiers (deeply, truly, fundamentally, inherently, simply, literally, inevitably) | Empty emphasis |
| Starting sentences with "I" repeatedly | Self-focused |
| "Very" + adjective | Weak. Pick a stronger adjective |
