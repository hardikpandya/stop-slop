# Structures to Avoid

## Binary Contrasts

These create false drama. State the point directly.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Not because X. Because Y." | Telegraphed reversal |
| "[X] isn't the problem. [Y] is." | Formulaic reframe |
| "The answer isn't X. It's Y." | Predictable pivot |
| "It feels like X. It's actually Y." | Setup/reveal cliche |
| "The question isn't X. It's Y." | Rhetorical misdirection |
| "Not X. But Y." | Mechanical contrast |
| "It's not this. It's that." | Same formula, different words |
| "stops being X and starts being Y" | False transformation arc |

**Instead:** State Y directly. "The problem is Y." "Y matters here."

## Dramatic Fragmentation

Sentence fragments for emphasis read as manufactured profundity.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "[Noun]. That's it. That's the [thing]." | Performative simplicity |
| "X. And Y. And Z." | Staccato drama |
| "This unlocks something. [Word]." | Artificial revelation |

**Instead:** Complete sentences. Trust content over presentation.

## Rhetorical Setups

These announce insight rather than deliver it.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "What if [reframe]?" | Socratic posturing |
| "Here's what I mean:" | Redundant preview |
| "Think about it:" | Condescending prompt |
| "And that's okay." | Unnecessary permission |

**Instead:** Make the point. Let readers draw conclusions.

## Formulaic Constructions

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "By the time X, I was Y." | Narrative template |
| "X that isn't Y" | Indirect. Say "X is broken" |

## Rhythm Patterns

| Pattern | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Three-item lists | Use two items or one |
| Questions answered immediately | Let questions breathe or cut them |
| Paragraphs starting with "So" | Start with content |
| Sentences starting with "Look," | Remove |
| Every paragraph ends punchily | Vary endings |
| Em-dashes before reveals | Use periods or commas |
| Staccato fragmentation | Don't stack short punchy sentences |
| Dashes for dramatic pause | Use commas or periods |
| "Not always. Not perfectly." | Hedging disguised as reassurance |

## Word Patterns

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Absolute words (always, never, everyone, everybody, nobody) | False authority |
| AI-overused intensifiers (deeply, truly, fundamentally, inherently, simply, literally, inevitably) | Empty emphasis |

## Transformation Chains
Words that link end-to-end, creating false momentum.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "X became Y. Y became Z." | Artificial momentum |
| "Friction becomes flow. Flow becomes speed." | Chain linking |
| "Word slop became legibility. Legibility became clarity." | False progression |
| "Bottlenecks become opportunities. Opportunities become growth." | Manufactured causation |

**Instead:** State the outcome directly. "The process is now faster."

## Before/After Framing
False historical contrast to manufacture significance.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Before X, it was Y." | Manufactured history |
| "Before AI, it was manual." | False transformation arc |
| "Before this framework, teams struggled." | Exaggerated contrast |

**Instead:** Describe the current state. Skip the manufactured history.

## Corrective Reveals
Dramatic "truth telling" structure that positions the writer as enlightened.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "You've been told X. Here's the truth: Y." | Theatrical setup |
| "You've been told a lie. Here is the actual truth." | False authority |
| "Everyone says X. They're wrong." | Contrarian posturing |

**Instead:** State Y directly without the theatrical setup.

## Forced Cohesion
Artificially linking separate ideas to sound profound.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "You can't have X without Y." | False interdependence |
| "You can't have one without the other." | Manufactured connection |
| "These two things are linked." | Vague binding |

**Instead:** If they're truly linked, the connection will be clear from context.
