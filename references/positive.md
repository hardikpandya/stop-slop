# What Good Writing Does

Anti-slop is half the job. Removing bad patterns produces clean but lifeless text. This file describes what to aim for.

## Be Specific

Replace vague claims with concrete facts. Dates, names, numbers, sources.

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|---------|
| "Many experts agree" | "A 2024 MIT study of 200 firms found" |
| "significant improvement" | "latency dropped from 340ms to 90ms" |
| "has been widely adopted" | "used by 14,000 teams as of January 2026" |

## Use Simple Constructions

Prefer "is", "are", "has" over elaborate substitutes.

| Elaborate | Simple |
|-----------|--------|
| "serves as a foundation for" | "is the foundation of" |
| "stands as a reminder of" | "reminds us" |
| "boasts a collection of" | "has" |
| "represents a shift toward" | "is a shift toward" |

## Active Voice

Subject does the thing. Passive voice hides the actor.

| Passive | Active |
|---------|--------|
| "The decision was made by the team" | "The team decided" |
| "Errors were introduced during migration" | "The migration introduced errors" |
| "It has been argued that" | "[Scholar] argues that" |

Exception: passive is appropriate when the agent is genuinely unknown or irrelevant ("The temple was built in the 3rd century BCE").

## Positive Form

State what is, not what isn't. Negatives require readers to invert.

| Negative | Positive |
|----------|---------|
| "He was not very often on time" | "He usually came late" |
| "She did not think the study was useful" | "She thought the study was useless" |
| "not unlike" | "like" |
| "not infrequently" | "often" |

## Vary Rhythm

Monotone sentence length signals algorithmic generation. Mix it up.

Short sentence. Then a longer one that takes its time. Then short again. This creates natural reading cadence that no pattern-matching detector flags.

Two items in a list beat three. Three is the LLM default.

## Have a Voice

Soulless writing is as detectable as slop. Signs of voiceless text:
- Every sentence is the same length and structure
- No opinions, only neutral reporting
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty or mixed feelings
- No humor, edge, or personality

How to fix it:
- React to facts, don't just report them
- "I don't know how to feel about this" is more human than a balanced pros-and-cons list
- Use "I" when appropriate—first person is not unprofessional
- Let some mess in—tangents and half-formed thoughts are human

## Trust the Reader

Don't explain what you just showed. Don't announce significance.

| Hand-holding | Trusting |
|-------------|---------|
| "This is significant because it shows that..." | Just show it. |
| "In other words, ..." | If your first words were clear, you don't need other ones. |
| "Let that sink in." | It already did. |
| "Think about it." | They already are. |

## Acknowledge Complexity

Real subjects are messy. Pretending otherwise signals synthetic origin.

| Oversimplified | Human |
|----------------|-------|
| "AI coding tools are transformative" | "AI coding tools speed up boilerplate but don't help with design decisions" |
| "The policy was successful" | "The policy reduced emissions 12% but displaced 3,000 workers" |
